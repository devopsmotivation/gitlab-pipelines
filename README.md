# gitlab-pipelines

A GitLab CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) YAML file, often referred to as .gitlab-ci.yml, is a configuration file that defines the jobs, stages, and rules for your CI/CD pipeline in a GitLab project. This file is written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), which is a human-readable data serialization format.

The .gitlab-ci.yml file allows you to specify how your code should be built, tested, and deployed whenever changes are pushed to the repository. It defines a series of jobs and stages, where each stage represents a phase in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy).
